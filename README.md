L2​ ​Back​ ​End​ ​Coding​ ​Challenge
L2 is interested in benchmarking the search visibility of prominent television brands on
bestbuy.com. Your challenge is to create an automated data collection tool that will
collect daily snapshots of data and yield a data set capable of answering the following
questions:
1. Given a set of competitor brands, for a given time range, for a given search term,
what percentage of search results are owned by each brand?
2. Given a set of competitor brands, for a given time range, for a given search term,
what percentage of the top 3 search results are owned by each brand?
3. Is there a correlation between the number of reviews and search ranking?
4. Is there a correlation between the rating and search ranking?
5. (Optional) If you’re able to run your app multiple times, how volatile are the ranks
on day-to-day basis?
For this exercise the brand list is as follows:

Samsung
LG
Toshiba
Sony

The relevant search keywords as are follows:

smart tv
curved smart tv

Upon completion of the assignment please share your source code with us via github.
Your repository should also contain instructions on how to run the program and a
sample of the data you were able to collect in csv format. The technologies you choose
are up to you.
